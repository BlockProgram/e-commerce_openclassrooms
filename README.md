# Project nÂ°5 - *[OpenClassrooms Web Dev' Bootcamp](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/141-web-developer)*

This is an e-commerce website for the 5th project of the OpenClassrooms Web Developer course. The backend was provided by the platform for this project, my only mission was to develop the frontend. 

Here is what I coded to pass the examination: 
* AJAX requests (GET, POST) 
* responsive UI
* cart management (JS & LocalStorage) 
* form validation (JS & Regex) 


### Prerequisites ###

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

### Installation ###

Clone this repo. From within the project folder, run `npm install`. You 
can then run the server with `node server` **from within the "backend" subfolder**. 
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.

Finally, you only need to host the interface locally with the *[Live Server extension](https://ritwickdey.github.io/vscode-live-server/)*  or any other solution.
